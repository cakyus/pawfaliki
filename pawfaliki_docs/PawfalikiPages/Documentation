@@install@@__**:: Installation ::**__
Pawfaliki requires a working installation of [[http://www.php.net|php]]. It has been tested with php-4.3.10 & php-5.0.2.

1. Copy the ''pawfaliki.php'' file onto you webserver.

2. Create a directory under the path where pawfaliki.php is located and call it something like ''~~~PawfalikiPages~~~''.

3. Chmod this directory so that php can write to it - this is where all your wiki content will be stored.
	 
4. Create another directory under the path where pawfaliki.php is located and call it something like ''~~~PawfalikiTemp~~~''.

5. Chmod this directory so that php can write to it - this is where temporary backup files will be stored. This directory will be regularly emptied of files by Pawfaliki so don't use it for storing anything else.

6. Configure your ''pawfaliki.php'' file (see [[#config|Configuration]] section below).


@@config@@__**:: Configuration ::**__

The look of Pawfaliki can be configured using CSS. An example css file is included called ''pawfaliki.css'' which you can use to make your wiki look like [[http://www.pawfal.org|www.pawfal.org]] - great! 

Very near the top of ''pawfaliki.php'' is the configuration section. This consists of a collection of variables stored in the ''$config'' array which you can edit as you require. A description of these variables can be found below.

If you're overwriting a few of these settings it may be easier to put all your settings in an additional PHP file and specify it using the ''~~~$config['CONFIGFILE']~~~'' variable - see the exampleconfig.php file included with pawfaliki for an example.

''~~~$config['CONFIGFILE']~~~''

@@userguide@@__**:: User Guide ::**__

@@usr_editing@@__Editing Pages__
To edit a wiki page simply click the **edit** button at the bottom of the page. Be prepared to enter a valid password if access for that page has been restricted - look for **(locked)** or similar near the edit button.

@@usr_syntax@@__Syntax__
{{images/pawfalikidocs_syntax.png}}
''Pawfaliki syntax.''

@@usr_backup@@__Backup & Restore__
If backup/restore is enabled for your wiki you can easily backup all the wiki pages to a single file and then restore them using that file at a later time.

To backup the wiki click the **backup** link at the bottom of the **~~~PageList~~~** page. The wiki will backup all the pages to a temporary backup file on the remote server and provide a download link. Right-click the link and save the file to your local drive. The temporary file will remain on the remote server for at least 5 minutes, after that it will be removed the next time the wiki is refreshed.

{{images/pawfalikidocs_backup1.png}}
''Backup download link.''

To restore the wiki click the **restore** link at the bottom of the **~~~PageList~~~** page. You will be provided with a file upload form and a password box. 

{{images/pawfalikidocs_restore1.png}}
''File upload & password box.''

Select the backup file from your local drive and enter a valid password. Click **restore** to begin restoring your backed up wiki pages. When the process is complete (this may take a few moments depending on the speed of the remote server and how many pages you are restoring) you will be presented with a log of which pages were restored. 

{{images/pawfalikidocs_restore2.png}}
''Restore log.''

Note that any existing pages that exist in the backup will be overwritten but pages that do not exist in the backup will remain unchanged.

@@usr_rss@@__Using RSS__
You can access the RSS feed for your wiki (if it's enabled - see the RSS section in [[#config|Configuration]]) by pointing your news aggregator to the wiki url followed by **?format=rss**.
For example: [[http://www.pawfal.org/?format=rss]]


@@techref@@__**:: Technical Reference ::**__

@@pawfalikifunctions@@__Utilising Pawfaliki PHP Functions__
Pawfaliki can be used as a wiki code parser instead of a full wiki-engine.

Simply include the following code in your own PHP script:

''<?php''
''  $PAWFALIKI_FUNCTIONS_ONLY = 1;''
''  require("pawfaliki.php");''
''?>''

You can then use the ''wikiParse()'' function which takes a string of wiki code and returns it as valid HTML:

''<?php''
''  ~~~$myWikiCode = "this is **bold** and this is ''italic''";~~~''
''  ~~~$myHTML = wikiParse( $myWikiCode );~~~''
''  echo( $myHTML );''
''?>''
