                     ** Pawfaliki v0.4.0 **
												

REQUIREMENTS
============		
									
A working installation of php. 
Pawfaliki has been tested with php-4.3.10 & php-5.0.2.


INSTALLATION
============

1. Copy the pawfaliki.php file onto you webserver.

2. Create a directory under the path where pawfaliki.php is located and 
   call it something like PawfalikiPages.

3. Chmod this directory so that php can write to it. 
   This is where all your wiki content will be stored.
	 
4. Create another directory under the path where pawfaliki.php is located
   and call it something like PawfalikiTemp.

5. Chmod this directory so that php can write to it - this is where temporary 
   backup files will be stored. 
   This directory will be regularly emptied of files by Pawfaliki so don't use
   it for storing anything else.

6. Configure your pawfaliki.php file (see CONFIGURATION section below).
