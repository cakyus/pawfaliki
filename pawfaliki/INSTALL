_Requirements_
	A working install of php.

_Installation_
1. Copy the pawfaliki.php file onto you webserver.
2. Create a directory under the path where pawfaliki.php is located and call it Pages.
3. Chmod Pages so that php can write to it.

_Customisation_
Edit the lines in the config section (very near the top of the file) as you require:
$config['TITLE'] is the name of the wiki as it will appear in the titlebar.
$config['HOMEPAGE'] allows an alternative name for the wiki homepage.
$config['ADMIN'] admin contact as it will appear in error messages.
$config['CSS'] (optional) add a css style sheet in the format TITLE:FILEPATH
$config['LOCKED'][**pagename**] (optional) lock **pagename** so it can't be edited

An example css file is included called pawfaliki.css which you can use to make your wiki look like pawfal - great! Also, feel free to edit the license() function (found just after the config section) to fit you requirements.

_Problems_
